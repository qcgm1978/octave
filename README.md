You can use rehash this will Octave reinitialize its directory cache, see http://octave.sourceforge.net/octave/function/rehash.html).You can also use clear functionName which should clean all variables in the function and trigger a reload (you script would be called functionName.m).https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28903974/how-to-make-gnu-octave-reload-scripts-each-time-they-are-runTo install a package from the Octave Forge, at the Octave prompt type pkg install -forge package_name. This requires an internet connection.load:   pkg load financialdebug mode: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20348811/how-is-the-octave-debugger-usedTake a look at the Debugging section of the Octave manual.For your case, you should place debug_on_warning (1) at the top of your script so it stops when the warning happens and drops you in debug mode. Then type dbwhere to find out where you are.An alternative, that's the way I do it, leave the command keyboard in certain areas where you think the problem may be. Then use dbstep to evaluate your script line by line.If set to "none", Octave will always check time stamps on files to determine whether functions defined in function files need to recompiled.  ignore_function_time_stamp ( "none")    Terminal search  grep -r 'subplot' /Users/zhanghongliang/Documents/Octave
