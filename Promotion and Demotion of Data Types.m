##Many operators and functions can work with mixed data types. For example,assert(uint8 (1) + 1,uint8(2))assert(uint8(2)==uint32(2))##the type is demoted toassert(single (1) + 1,single(2))##double OP charassert(1+"a",98)assert(class(1+"a"),"double")##The same logic applies to functions with mixed arguments such asassert(class(min (single (1), 0)),"single")##In the case of mixed type indexed assignments, the type is not changed. For example,x = ones (2, 2);    x(1, 1) = single (2);assert(    class(x(1,1)),"double")assert(class(x),"double")assert(class([]),"double")assert(typeinfo([]),"null_matrix")assert(typeinfo(x),"matrix")
