% FUNCTION: [assignments, centers] = kmeans(X, k, centers = 0, maxiter = 200)
% DESCRIPTION: This function performs k-means clustering algorithm on a given 
%              dataset. 
%
% INPUTS:   X = N*d matrix of dataset, rows of X correspond to N data points; 
%               columns correspond to attributes.
%           k = number of clusters
%     centers = Starting centers of clusters.
%     maxiter = Maximum iteration count for convergence.
%
% OUTPUTS: assignments = Integer vector that holds
